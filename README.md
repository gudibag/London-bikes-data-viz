# London Bikes Data Visualization Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of the London bikes dataset and the using Python and Tableau.
The goal of this project is to gain insights into the bike usage system in London and present the findings through engaging visual representations. Furthermore, this project was to investigate possible patterns in the usage of data, influenced by factors such as temperature, wind-speed, and the presence of weekends. The dataset was programmatically downloaded in a Jupyter notebook using Python, and Tableau was utilized to create interactive and informative visualizations. .

## Introduction

The London bikes dataset contains information of the bike-usage system in the city gotten spanning a three-year period from 2014 to 2017. It contains information such as temperature, humidity, weather_code and bike count. By leveraging Python for data exploration and Tableau for visualization, this project aims to uncover valuable insights that can aid in understanding the bike sharing landscape and inform decision-making processes.

##  Summary

The analysis of the London bikes dataset resulted in several findings and key takeaways:

- Patterns in bike usage were observed, with higher demand during peak commuting hours and lower usage during weekends.
- Bike usages observed a bimodal distribution with peaks occurring at the start and close of work during the workdays  (Monday - Friday)
- Peak periods were also observed during mid-year (June) and dipping at the beginning-start of the next year. This corresponds to Summer time (June - August) and Winter (December - February)
- Weather conditions were found to impact bike usage, with more rentals on sunny and mild days compared to rainy or extremely hot days.
## Conclusion

Through the combination of Python for data exploration and Tableau for visualization, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the London bike-usage system. The interactive visualizations created in Tableau allow users to explore the data and gain deeper insights into bike usage patterns, and user behavior, and system dynamics.

The findings from this analysis can be valuable to various stakeholders, including city planners, transportation authorities, and bikers. They can inform decision-making processes, such as optimizing bike station locations, improving bike distribution strategies, and enhancing overall user experience within the bike sharing system.

## Limitations
This data does not take into account variables such as user demographics, geographical location, user types and user preferences.
